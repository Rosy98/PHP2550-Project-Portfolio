# PHP2550-Project-1
## Introduction
This repository is created for Project 1 of PHP2515. The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data collected by Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences. Exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are two of the major public health concerns. These exposures are associated with an increased risk of externalizing behaviors, such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, rates of substance use problems and self-regulation problems, which involve maintaining physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive control. The goal for this explortory analysis project is to investigate the effects of SDP/ETS on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing behaviors. The language used for this project is R.
